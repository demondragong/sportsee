<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- [NodeJS (**version 12.18**)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Install and run the backend following the instructions from the [backend repository]([https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard]).
    The backend should be running on port 3000 (check that you get data at http://localhost:3000/user/12).

2. Clone the current repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/demondragong/sportsee.git
   ```

3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the react app on the development server. It will likely warn you that port 3000 is already in use and ask to use another port instead. Type Y (yes).
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
